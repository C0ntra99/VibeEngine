# VibeEngine Server
## Description
The VibeEngine server is what is used to manage scoring of the clients. Clients connect to the server and the server will put clients into a round or score them individually.  

The server is designed in such a way that the client and the server can be run parallel on the same system OR the server can on a separate system. These settings are configured with the `VibeEngine` cli. 

## Workflow
- Client registers with server (*see REST API section*)
    - Client will report the engine configuration and team configuration
    - In the team configuration there will be a round option. If the round is not already running on the server then a new round will be created
- Once the client is registered and a round is started the server will periodically send `GET` requests to the clients to get an update of the score
- Clients response with the score will get updated in the MongoDB  
- Round scores will get displayed with data from the MongoDB or accessed directly via the REST API.

## REST API  
There are 3 endpoint for the rest API which are all used to interface with the backend MongoDB database. 



### Round
For each round is being grouped by teams. Each team has a list of running instances.  
**Schema**
```
{
    name: String,
    uid: String,
    teams:[
        {
            team: {type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Teams'},
            running_instances: [{type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Instances'}]
        }
    ],
    config: {
        timeLimit: Date,
        instanceLimit: Number
    }
}
```  
`GET /api/rounds?key=value`  
Resp:
```
```  
`POST /api/rounds`  
Body:  
```
```
Resp:
```
```

### Instance
Each client that reports in will create an instance. The instance is assigned to a team in the round.  
**Schema**
```
{
    os_details:{
        hostname:String,
        release: String,
        network:{
            ip: String,
            mac: String
        }
    },
    scoring_config: Object,
    team: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Teams'},
    score: {
        current: Number,
        previous: Number
    },
    uid: String,
    running: Boolean,
    round: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Rounds'}
}
```
`GET /api/instances?key=value`  
As of of now you have the ability to search for any key/value pair that is in the document. This also enabled you to refine searches to match multiple parameters.   

_Adding `verbose=true` to the url will resolve the team ObjectID to the respective document._  

`POST /api/instances`  
Body:  
```
{
	"os_details":{
		"hostname":"test_os",
		"release":"ArchLinux uWu",
		"network": {
            "ip":"192.168.0.69",
            "mac":"18:1d:ea:4c:48:ab"
        }
	},
	"scoring_config": "WIP",
	"team":{
		"team_name":"test2"
	}
}
```  
Resp:  
```

    }
}
```
### Team
Each client will be associated with a team or assigned an empty team. 
  
**Schema**
```
{
    team_name: String,
    team_number: String,
    uid: String,
    instances: [
        {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref:'Instances'}
    ] 
}
```

`GET /api/teams?team_name=test2`  
As of of now you have the ability to search for any key/value pair that is in the document. This also enabled you to refine searches to match multiple parameters.  

_Adding `verbose=true` to the url will resolve the instance ObjectID to the respective documents._
