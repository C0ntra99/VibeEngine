# Overview
The VibeEngine is a CyberPatriot scoring engine for teams around the world to use as a practice resource. If you don't know what CybePatriot is you can read up on it [here](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/Pages/About/What-is-CyberPatriot.aspx).  

VibeEngine is created in such a way that it simulates a real world CyberPatriot competition. This means that teams will have the ability to create their own round and practice images.  

_Disclaimer: This readme does not go into too much detail due to everything still being in development._  


# Design
The engine is designed in 2 parts allowing for 3 ways of deployment. The two parts are as follows:

### VibeEngine-Server
The server is responsible for mangaging the scoring of the clients that are connected to it. In order for a VibeEngine Client to score the server it is running on it must be connected to a server. The server will periodally send a request to each of its connected clients to retrieve a score. All the scores for each round or connected client is then displayed on a webpage that is hosted by the server.  

_More info [Here](https://github.com/C0ntra99/VibeEngine-Server)_

### VibeEngine-Client
The client is responsible for the actual scoring of the instance. Once a score request is recieved from a server the client will read its scoring configuration file and score accordingly. Once the scoring is completed it will be sent back to the server to be displayed.

# Deployments
Since the VibeEngine is designed in a modular fashion it is flexible in how it is deployed. The 3 main deployment methods are described bellow:  

1. Server:
- Description: Is not running any sort of checks on the machine.  
- Reason: Meant to act as a centralized scoreboard for multiple connected clients that are on the same LAN.
2. Client
- Description: Only runs the checks on a machine. Does not have the ablity to display scores. 
- Reason: If there is already a VibeEngine Server deployed on the network.
3. Standalone
- Description: Hosts BOTH the VibeEngine Client and Server on the same machine. Meant for standalone instance scoring. Scoreboard and scoring logic is all in one place. 
- Reason: Meant to have the ability so if one person wanted to practive indivdually.

# Configuration
In order to properly configure the VibeEngine this CLI was written. This manages the installation and deployment process for the VibeEngine.
